# Javascript / HTML Examples

These are mostly fairly generic examples using jQuery / ajax calls to demonstrate the Token Based Auth and various methods. We will add more examples regularly and if you have any suggestions (based on what's in the WADL docs), create an issue and we can prioritize those examples. 

Most of the examples demonstrate the credentials object with a statically coded username and password, however this is obviously NOT how you would implement in production. The username / password should NEVER be stored anywhere unencrypted.
