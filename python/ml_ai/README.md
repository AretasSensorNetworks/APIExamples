# Machine Learning and AI Examples with the Aretas Platform

Machine Learning with IoT data is one of the most interesting aspects of machine learning and AI. 
There are nearly unlimited applications and use cases for ML/AI in the IoT industry. This collection of tutorials
will cover ML/AI APIs from the Aretas API as well as other popular frameworks (if you want to roll your own ML or AI in Python)

We'll focus mostly on **realtime** AI, but also other analytical and forecasting methods. The main topics will be:

1. ####Anomaly Detection
2. ####Time Series Forecasting
3. ####Probabilistic Methods
4. #### Event Detection and Classification
5. #### Sensor Data Classifiers
6. #### Recommender Systems
7. #### Location Data Specific Filters and Methods
