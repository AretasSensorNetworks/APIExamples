# KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) Example
This example demonstrates how to perform very basic KDE (Gaussian) fit to time series sensor data from the Aretas REST API

The example demonstrates:
1. Logging in to the API and generating an access token
2. Performing basic data queries
3. Plotting time series data
4. Plotting sensor data histogram
5. Basic KDE fitting
