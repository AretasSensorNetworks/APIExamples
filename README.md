# Aretas API Documentation and Examples
Various Examples for the Aretas IoT API

## Companion Documentation
The Aretas Knowledge Base will contain companion documentation (Tutorials, Introductions, etc.). You can access that here: http://www2.aretas.ca/knowledge-base/

## REST API
Most of the Aretas IoT REST API methods are documented through the automatic WADL generator. You can find those here:
https://aretassensornetworks.github.io/APIExamples/swadl/wadl.html

The WADL generator does not pick up on Websockets or some of the Event and/or ML microservice methods (for obvious reasons). We'll document those separately. It's also perpetually out of date 

## Python
The Python entries are the most updated, there are lots of examples in there in including several ML examples. 

## Javascript
The Javascript entries will generally be basic .html files that execute the method (using jquery) and return results for viewing, nothing fancy. The documentation will evolve significantly over the next few months.
